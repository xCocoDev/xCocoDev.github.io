                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="game-text"><span style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600;">As of that moment for the next two years </span> I spent my spare time in learning and extending the TrinityCore C++ framework <a href="https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>. Right after that I got hired as a freelancer for multiple WoW servers around the world as my programming skills started to grow.</h3>
                    <h3 class="game-text"><span style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600;">Three years later I end up working full-time </span> for the biggest World of Warcraft private servers in the world where I have been working ever since (until April 2019).</h3>
                    <h3 class="game-text"><span style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600;">During those years I had the chance</span> to work with top industry professionals that are working in AAA studios and a huge code base and learn a lot from this experience.</h3>
